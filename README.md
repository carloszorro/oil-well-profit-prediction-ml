# 🛢️ Oil Well Profit Prediction with Machine Learning  

> Predicted oil well reserves and optimized drilling site selection with Linear Regression and bootstrapping, minimizing financial risk (<2.5%).  

✅ Español: Predicción de reservas de pozos petroleros y selección óptima de ubicación de perforación usando regresión lineal y bootstrapping, minimizando el riesgo financiero (<2.5%).  

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project is part of the **Sprint 11: Machine Learning for Business** module at TripleTen Latam.  
The challenge was to support **OilyGiant**, a petroleum extraction company, in selecting the most profitable drilling locations for 200 new oil wells.  

---

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed  
- Loaded and explored oil well datasets from three regions.  
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model to predict reserve volumes.  
- Selected the top 200 wells with the highest predicted reserves.  
- Estimated total profit for each region.  
- Performed **bootstrapping analysis** to evaluate risks and confidence intervals.  
- Applied risk criteria (loss probability < 2.5%) to select the safest and most profitable region.

## 📂 Dataset Description  
Datasets contained geologic survey information from three regions:  
- `id`: unique identifier of the oil well.  
- `f0`, `f1`, `f2`: features from geological measurements.  
- `product`: reserve volume (in thousands of barrels).

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)  
- Bootstrapping for risk analysis  

---

## 📈 Results  
- Built regression models to predict reserve volumes.  
- Identified the **most profitable region** for drilling while minimizing risk.  
- Selected wells ensuring risk of losses was kept under **2.5%**, meeting business requirements.
